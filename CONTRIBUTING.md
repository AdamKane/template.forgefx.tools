Here's a nice example of our coding style:

```python
    def get_all_channels_with_placeholder_bookmark_link_urls(self):
        
        # Find all channels with bookmarks that have a placeholder URL (www.google.com)
        channels_with_bookmarks = []
        
        # Retrieve all channels in the Slack workspace
        all_channels = self.get_all_channels()
        
        # Iterate through each channel
        for channel in all_channels:
            channel_id = channel['id']
            
            # Get all bookmarks for the current channel
            bookmarks = self.get_channel_bookmarks(channel_id)
            
            # Check each bookmark in the channel
            for bookmark in bookmarks:
                
                # Look for bookmarks with the placeholder URL 'www.google.com'
                link = bookmark.get('link')
                if link and 'google.com' in link:
                    
                    # If found, add channel and bookmark info to the result list
                    channels_with_bookmarks.append({
                        'channel_id': channel_id,
                        'channel_name': channel.get('name'),
                        'bookmark': bookmark
                    })
                    
                    # Exit the loop after finding one matching bookmark
                    # This ensures we only report each channel once
                    break
        
        # Return the list of channels with placeholder bookmarks
        return channels_with_bookmarks
```
